An clinical-academic lab group based between UCLH and UCL's Institute of Health Informatics.
Our clinical focus starts with critical care but we have active collaborations with anaesthesia, peri-operative medicine, global health, and acute medicine.
We meet (virtually) every Wednesday. Get in touch if you'd like to drop in to one of our lab meetings. Otherwise feel free to come and say hello at UCLH_.
