In the previous section, we made some grand claims about Hylode addressing:\n~ train-deploy split\n~ feature provision\n~ time-series modelling\n~ model management\n~ transition to deployment\nLet’s see a concrete example of how this looks.\n\nRetrospective training set. Extraction & pre-processing\nFor the sake of these notebooks, we’re going to consider the problem of modelling ICU discharge at 48 hours.\n\n# First off, Hylode immediately gives us the features we need to train a time series model\nfrom hycastle.icu_store.retro import retro_dataset\n\ntrain_df = retro_dataset('T03')\ntrain_df.shape\n\nThis single piece of code has done a lot of work behind the scenes.\nIt has pulled data from EMAP, processed it where necessary to create features and then cut those features up so we have one row per hour for each patient – setting us up to make live predictions every hour for each patient on the unit.\nLet’s have a look at which features we have:\n\ntrain_df.columns\n\nThis is great, but we still have some categorical variables etc. laced in there. What happens if I want to do some pre-processing?\nThe answer lies in our lens abstraction, let’s have a look at one I prepared earlier:\n\nfrom hycastle.lens.icu import BournvilleICUSitRepLens\nlens = BournvilleICUSitRepLens()\n\nX_train = lens.fit_transform(train_df)\nX_train.columns\n\nWe can see we’ve just done some useful things. The lens’s fit_transform method has inserted missingness values for ethnicity, and we have broken out each patient’s admissions time into separate features as we think that will improve our model.\nWe also define a label:\n\ny_train = train_df['discharged_in_48hr'].astype(int)\n\n\n\nTraining & storing a model\nWith this “heavy” lifting done, we should now already be in a position to train a model. Let’s have a go:\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nm = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1)\nm.fit(X_train.values, y_train.values.ravel())\n\nEverything seems to be working. Let’s imagine we’re happy with what we’ve done. Let’s log the model in our model repo, so it’s primed and ready to deploy…\n\nimport os\nimport mlflow\nmlflow_server = os.getenv('HYMIND_REPO_TRACKING_URI')\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(mlflow_server)\n\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport random\nimport string\n\n# Generate a unique experiment name\nexp_name = \"vignette_0-\" + \"\".join( random.sample(string.ascii_lowercase, k=8)) + str(datetime.now().timestamp())\n\nos.environ[\"MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME\"] = exp_name\nexperiment_id = mlflow.create_experiment(exp_name)\n\nexperiment_id\n\n\nwith mlflow.start_run():\n    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(m, 'model')\n\nThis screenshot shows what it looks like for the model to land safely in MLFlow (which you should be able to see for yourself if you follow the link here – look for a new experiment at the very bottom of the list on the left hand side)\n\n\nLoading and deploying a model\nNow let’s switch hats and imagine they were are trying to deploy the model in silent mode for the patients currently on the ICU. This is now pretty straightforward:\n\nfrom hycastle.icu_store.live import live_dataset\nlive_df = live_dataset('T03')\nlive_df.shape\n\n\nlive_df.columns\n\n\nX_df = lens.transform(live_df)\n\n\nruns = mlflow.search_runs(experiment_ids=[experiment_id])\nrun_id = runs.iloc[0].run_id\nrun_id\n\n\nlogged_model = f'runs:/{run_id}/model'\nloaded_model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(logged_model)\n\n\npredictions = loaded_model.predict_proba(X_df.values)\nlive_df['prediction'] = predictions[:, 1]\nlive_df.loc[:, ['bed_code', 'prediction']].head()"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the Hylode platform. Thank you for making it this far.\nOver the next four notebooks, we hope to bring you from zero to sixty on why we developed the platform and how to use it.\nThe backdrop to this infastructural work is a world where translating published EHR-driven ML4H models into deployment is hard. Reseachers internationally lament this implementation gap1. Even at UCLH, flush with a new EHR and live data infrastructure in EMAP, the last mile in pushing a retrospective model requires a lot of one-off project-specific work.\nIntent on doing meaningful research and innovation in a safety critical environment - paving the way for live deployments - deployment needs to be taken more seriously. In particular, the deployment problems that the Hylode platform is looking to address include:\n\nRisk of train-deploy split, where discrepency between training and deployment code lower performance\nData drift and feature drift, where underlying shifts in the dataset harm performance unnoticed\nAd hoc ongoing model monitoring and evaluation, where continuous model scrutiny relies on ad hoc batch evaluation\n\nWe address these problem by presenting a single framework that:\na) brings together training and deployment in the same modelling workflow\nb) integrates MLOps modules addressing data drift, model evaluation etc. alongside the main platform\nRather than ad hoc algorithm deployment, Hylode is a platform for training deployable EHR models.\n\nCase to the ML4H researcher…\nDoes all this come at the expense of ease and speed for the ML researcher?\nWe hope not. Engineered into Hylode are abstractions crafted to make the specific kind of modelling EHR ML practitioners do easier, faster and more joyful.\nIn particular:\n\nHylode provides a curated set of features easily interfacing w/ other UCLH data resources such as EMAP & Caboodle. Over time, we hope the store of pre-canned features will grow, cutting the time spent on wrangling, and freeing it up for more modelling work.\nBuilt for time-series EHR data Hylode automates many of the more fiddly elements of training a time-series ML4H model. It eases splitting patient records into temporal slices (the training instances needed to feed time-series EHR models).\nEase of experimental logging & model development The Hylode system makes it easy to log results & create reproducible workflows. The same tooling then makes it straightforward to pass models over from ML teams to application developers, to then present the predictions in a clinically meaningful way.\n\nWe see these three strengths as coming together to make Hylode a central resource to develop deployable ML models at UCLH. The core driver here is that Hylode allows researchers to get their modelling done faster.\nFrom there, the deployment benefits of Hylode kick in. Starting from a single trained model, Hylode offers a seamless technical transition to running models in silent mode, and a clear path to application development and testing the real-time relevance of predictions in complex multi-disciplinary clinical settings.\n\n\nThe notebooks…\nBackground over, we can now get started on the tutorial. The basic structure of these notebooks is as follows:\n\nNotebook 0 A compact end-to-end modelling exemplar evidencing the claims above in c. 20 lines of code.\n\nFrom there, we switch to a more measured pace. The aim is to give the reader enough grounding to start working with the different system components themselves:\n\nNotebook 1 (HyCastle) More detail on feature access and preprocessing.\nNotebook 2 (HyMind) A fuller end-to-end modelling platform exemplifying how we have been using the platform so far.\nNotebook 3 (Appendix - HyFlow & HyGear) For those interested, a delve under the hood. Here you can start triangulating yourself as to how the data is pulled from EMAP.\n\n\n1. Seneviratne, M. G., Shah, N. H. & Chu, L. Bridging the implementation gap of machine learning in healthcare.

The example we look at here is running a simple parameter grid search for a Random Forest model of ICU discharge at 48 hours.\n\n# the two most influential parameters \n# cf. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#parameters\ngrid = {\n    'n_estimators':[10, 50, 100],\n    'max_features':[None, \"sqrt\", \"log2\"]\n}\n\n\n# as the outcome of each training run (even with the same parameters) is non-deterministic,\n# we run two training runs per parameter combination.\nruns_per_param_set = 2\n\nfor i in range(runs_per_param_set):\n    \n    for g in ParameterGrid(grid):\n        m = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1)\n\n        with mlflow.start_run():\n            \n            # logging the tag dictionary, the run_type\n            mlflow_log_tag_dict(tag_dict, 'tag_dict.yaml')\n            mlflow.set_tag(\"run_type\", \"training\")\n            \n            # set and log this run's set of model parameters\n            m.set_params(**g)\n            mlflow.log_params(g)\n\n            m.fit(X_train.values, y_train.values.ravel())\n            \n            # calculate and log training and validation set accuracy\n            train_accuracy = m.score(X_train.values, y_train.to_numpy())\n            mlflow.log_metric('train_accuracy', train_accuracy)\n            valid_accuracy = m.score(X_valid.values, y_valid.to_numpy())       \n            mlflow.log_metric('valid_accuracy', valid_accuracy)\n            \n            # ditto for confusion matrices\n            train_confusion = confusion_matrix(m.predict(X_train.values), y_train.to_numpy())\n            mlflow_log_string(train_confusion, 'train_confusion.txt')\n            valid_confusion = confusion_matrix(m.predict(X_valid.values), y_valid.to_numpy())\n            mlflow_log_string(valid_confusion, 'valid_confusion.txt')\n\n            # store the trained SKLearn model, so we can check it out later\n            mlflow.sklearn.log_model(m, 'model')\n\nAfter this cells runs (which takes a minute or two), if you now return to the MLFlow UI, you will see that the experiment you created is now populated with a whole list of runs, one for each parameter set above. Clicking down into the run you will see all the attributes above have been stored (the tag dictionary, the parameters, the metrics, the model etc.)\nAs a next step, we might want to pick out the model parameters that seem to have performed best - so we can then use these for further evaluation.\nThese runs can also be straightforwardly access from a notebook using mlflow.search_runs()…\n\nruns = mlflow.search_runs()\nruns.head()\n\nFrom which starting point, it’s simple to mark out the parameter set with the best mean validation accuracy, as follows:\n\nparams = [col for col in runs if col.startswith('params')]\nbest_params = runs.groupby(params)['metrics.valid_accuracy'].mean().idxmax()\nbest_row = runs.set_index(keys=params).loc[best_params]\n\nbest_run_id = list(best_row['run_id'])[0]\nbest_run_id\n\nAnd then we can tag this as the best run from our training loop - and also log the lens we used to train it:\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_id=best_run_id):\n    # tag the run as best_row\n    mlflow.set_tag('best_run', 1)   \n\n    # log the lens\n    mlflow_log_lens(lens)\n\nIn the same breath, MLFlow gives us the option to register our model, which makes it easy to access and work with going forward - so let’s do that too:\n\n# =&gt; add a unique model name below &lt;=\n# e.g. tk-random_forest-demo\nmodel_name =\n\n\n# n.b. each time you run this cell with the same model_name, the model version will increase by one\nregistered_model = mlflow.register_model(f'runs:/{best_run_id}/model', model_name)\n\nWhich is great. And now you should be able to navigate to the MLFlow UI - and if you click on the ‘Models’ tab at the top of the page you should see your newly registered model waiting there on the list."

    "text": "Accessing the hyflow schema directly\nDirectly querying the hylode database will return personally identifiable information\nLike most tables in the hylode database, the hyflow schema tables are all immutable logs.\nThat means data is only ever appended, never updated in place.\nThis also means, for example, that an individual patient will have many records in the icu_patients_log table,\none for each slice that was taken while their episode was active.\nImportant notes about direct Hylode DB access:\nThe queries provided through the functions in the hyflow & hygear packages take care of removing duplicates.\nIf you access the schemas directly you will need to do that yourself - see the various hyflow__*.sql files in hygear/load/sql for examples of partitioning over episode_slice_id and horizon_dt columns.\nOther conveniences are provided by the packages.\nFor example, the Postgres/SQLAlchemy/Pandas stack does not support storing timedeltas directly (even though it is a supported data type in both Postgres & Pandas, SQLAlchemy is unable to handle it).\nThat means the raw span column in the hyflow.icu_episode_slices_log table is in nanoseconds.\nConverting to a timedelta is done in the packages but you’ll have to do that yourself if you access the raw tables.\n\nICU Episode Slices with Bed Id\n\nsql_episode_slices_df = pd.read_sql(\n    '''\n        select \n            ep.id AS episode_slice_id\n            , ep.episode_key\n            , ep.csn\n            , ep.admission_dt\n            , ep.discharge_dt\n            , beds.source_id AS bed\n            , horizon_dt\n            , log_dt\n        from hyflow.icu_episode_slices_log ep\n            inner join hydef.beds beds ON ep.bed_id = beds.id\n            inner join hydef.bays bays ON beds.bay_id = bays.id\n         WHERE bays.ward_code = %(ward)s\n        order by episode_key, horizon_dt limit 1000\n    ''', \n    hydb_engine,\n    params={'horizon_dt': horizon_dt, 'ward': 'T03'}\n)\n\n\nsql_episode_slices_df\n\n\n\nICU Patients\n\nsql_patients_df = pd.read_sql('''\n    select \n        id AS patient_log_id\n        , episode_slice_id\n        , mrn\n        , name\n        , dob\n        , sex\n        , ethnicity\n        , postcode\n        , horizon_dt\n        , log_dt\n    from hyflow.icu_patients_log \n    order by mrn, horizon_dt limit 1000''', \n    hydb_engine\n)\n\n\nsql_patients_df\n\n\n\nICU Observations\n\nsql_obs_df = pd.read_sql('select * from hyflow.icu_observations_log order by episode_slice_id, horizon_dt limit 1000', hydb_engine)\n\n\nsql_obs_df"

    "title": "Training data",
    "section": "The lens",
    "text": "The lens\nIn the code above, we saw that HyCastle is very nifty in delivering us all the features we have pre-defined in hylode_db. But the question naturally arises, what if we want to use a subset of those features? Or to pre-process them in a specific way?\nWill this not require custom code - exposing us to the same risk of code divergence between training and deployment?\nOur answer to this is the lens. It is an abstraction that provides a more robust (transferrable) way to subset and pre-process the features coming out of HyCastle. Let’s have a look at a very simple example.\n\nfrom hycastle.lens.base import BaseLens\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom hycastle.lens.transformers import DateTimeExploder\n\n\nclass SimpleLens(BaseLens):\n    numeric_output = True\n    index_col = \"episode_slice_id\"\n\n    @property\n    def input_cols(self) -&gt; List[str]:\n        return [\n            \"episode_slice_id\",\n            \"admission_dt\",\n        ]\n\n    def specify(self) -&gt; ColumnTransformer:\n        return ColumnTransformer(\n            [\n                (\n                    \"select\",\n                    \"passthrough\",\n                    [\n                        \"episode_slice_id\"\n                    ],\n                ),\n                (\n                    \"admission_dt_exp\",\n                    DateTimeExploder(),\n                    [\"admission_dt\"],\n                ),\n            ]\n        )\n\nNotice that what we really have here is a list of 3-tuples to initialise the ColumnTransformer (which is a standard SKLearn class). For instance, the triple:\n                (\n                    \"admission_dt_exp\",\n                    DateTimeExploder(),\n                    [\"admission_dt\"],\n                )\nLet’s see what happens when we put this lens to work on the output from HyCastle\n\nlens = SimpleLens()\n\nX = lens.fit_transform(train_df)\nX.head()\n\n…basically we seem to have the episode_slice_id for every slice, and then a bunch of features about the admission_dt. In our original HyCastle dataset, we notice that admission_dt is a series of datetimes:\n\ntrain_df['admission_dt'].head()\n\n…but after we have transformed the retro dataframe, we have these additional admission features. This is thanks to the triple quoted above and the DateTimeExploder(). Let’s have a look to see what that code looks like…\n\n??DateTimeExploder\n\n\n??DateTimeExploder.transform\n\nIn short, what we are doing in defining a lens is defining a set of input columns from HyCastle that we want to work with, and then a sequence of column transformations (as a ColumnTransformer object) that we use to specifically define our pre-processing pathway.\nThis lens can then be used consistently between model training and deployment."

    "text": "What is the ‘Data Clinic’?\nThe Data Clinic is a Quality Improvement initiative to help frontline healthcare workers in Critical Care get data from EPIC.\nThis is to improve the ease and speed of audits, QIPs and service evaluations we perform in Critical Care.\n\n\nWhat are the issues that the Data Clinic is trying to solve?\nUCLH has invested millons of pounds to obtain an fully electronic health record system (EHRS) in the form of EPIC since 2019. It aims to be a leader in the field of technologically-enabled healthcare.\nThe current method for obtaining data from EPIC is through contacting the Buisness Intelligence (BI) team, whose role it is to monitor performance data in their department and service data requests. This has a number of issues:\n\n\nMany clinical staff are unaware of who the BI team are or what they do\nThe current process of requesting data often takes the form of numerous back-and-forth emails between clinical staff and the BI team, clarifying what data is required vs what is possible to extract. This process is often time-consuming and frustrating for both the clinical staff and BI team.\nAlthough the BI team have a good understanding of how to find data in Epic and manage it, sometimes they lack the clinical understanding and direction to provide learning from it.\n\n\nThe Data Clinic aims to improve the process of providing data to clinical staff using two approaches:\n\n\nWe aim to understand the clinical question the requestor is trying to answer and, with our knowledge of the data that is available, clarify exactly what data is required for their project.\nThen we work with the BI team to provide that data for the requestor as quickly as possible, in the form that the requestor needs.\n\n\nWe hypothesise that this shall benefit both clinical staff and the BI team.\n\nClinical staff:\n- makes the process of getting data from EPIC clearer\n- enhances understanding of the data that is available from EPIC\n- help with analysis of data (if required)\n- overall makes it easier to get the data needed to complete audit/QIP/service evaluations (thereby increasing the number of projects completed and improving patient care)\n\n\nBI team:\n- Saves time/frustration emailing back-and-forth with clinical staff\n- Better understanding of clinical relevance of their work (through feedback on the results of QI projects)\n\n\n\n(Current) Structure of the Data Clinic\nBelow is a brief, introductory overview of the current stucture of the Data Clinic. A more in-depth overview can be found in the Data Clinic Teams channel.\nRequests for data can currently come from 2 channels:\n\nA referral from the Audit/QI clinic (where a project has indicated that they need EPIC data to complete their project)\nA direct email to the Data Clinic email address or one of the members of the Data Clinic team.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, all audit/QIP should go through the Audit/QI clinic prior to being referred to the Data Clinic. This allows the Audit/QIP team to register the project, keep track of it and provide methodological support prior to the Data Clinic. Other data requests that are not audit/QI (e.g. service evaluation) are more likely to come through the second route.\nOnce a request has been recieved, a Data Fellow meets with the requestor to discuss their project and the data requirements.\nFollowing this, the Data Fellow shall meet with the BI team to perform a 1st extraction of the data. This shall be shown to the requestor.\nIf they are happy with this data, we then proceed to a full data extraction and delivery. If they are not satisfied, the extraction is revised and further meeting are arranged with the requestor until the data provided is adaquate (see the below flowchart for a graphical representation of this process)\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nA(Data request recieved) --&gt; B(Screened by Data Clinic team)\nB --&gt; C(Meeting with Data Clinic team)\nB --&gt; K(Can be served by existing report)\nC --&gt; D[1st extraction of data]\nD --&gt; F{2nd meeting between requestor & Data Clinic team}\nF --&gt; G[Happy with data]\nF --&gt; H[Revisions needed]\nG --&gt; I(Full extraction & data delivered)\nH --&gt; J(Further revision to extraction)\nJ --&gt; F\nK --&gt; L(Data delivered)\n\nlinkStyle default stroke: black;\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Data Clinic is being run as a QIP, this process is subject to change over time.\n\n\nRelevant People\n\nData Clinic\nDr Tim Bonnici: Data Lead for Critical Care (t.bonnici@nhs.net)\nData Fellows: Change yearly, previous fellows are listed below\n\n2021/22: Conor Foley, Dan Stein\n2022/23: Ruaraidh Campbell, Sarah Vaughan, Hrisheekesh Vaidya\n\n\n\nBI team\nTracey Crissell: Critical BI team lead (traceycrissell@nhs.net)\nHumayra Chowdhury: BI analyst (humayra.chowdhury@nhs.net)\nThe Data Clinic also works closely with the Audit/QI team and the Methodology Clinic team\n\n\nAudit/QI team\nVeronica (‘Ronnie’) Marsh: Audit/QI lead (veronica.marsh1@nhs.net)\n\n\nMethodology team\nSiri Steinmo: Quality Improvement Lead (siri.steinmo@nhs.net)\nPetra Voegele: PERRT nurse, Methodology clinic co-lead (petra.voegele@nhs.net)\n\n\n\nOnboarding information\nThis page will have given you a good general oversight of the Data Clinic and the people involved.\nHowever, if you are going to be working with the Data Clinic team, then you shall require some further information/orientation.\nBelow is a checklist of items to arrange to get up-and-running with the Data Clinic:\n\nObtain access to the Data Clinic Teams channel (contains more detailed information of structure of Data clinic, training on how to extract data from EPIC, a tracker for projects currently going through Data Clinic, records of previous projects)\n\nEmail Tim Bonicci to obtain\n\nRead through the comprehensive “Data Clinic Handover Document” & watch the video tour of the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nObtain access to the Data Clinic GitHub repository (contains code for extracting data from EPIC)\n\nEmail Tim Bonicci to obtain\n\nObtain access to Caboodle (EPIC’s main reporting database). Allows you to extract EPIC data.\n\nEmail David Thomson (Information Services Manager) to obtain (david.thompson19@nhs.net). You shall need to attend a mandatory training session with David before being given access\n\nComplete Caboodle training via EpicUserWeb\n\nTo sign up for an EpicUserWeb account, visit https://userweb.epic.com/Account/Register\n\nThere is a lot of training resources for using EPIC on EpicUserWeb, most of which is not relevant to the Data Clinic. The key learning to look at can be found in the “Recommended Reading List.docx” file, within the EPIC training folder in the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nComplete SQL learning (SQL is the coding language used for extracting data from reporting databases, such as Caboodle)\n\nThere are a number of free vs paid learning reserouces for this.\nPrevious Data Fellows have bought a subscription to DataCamp. This is paid for, however it is good for learning and also has other coding languages (e.g. python, R)\n\nThere are free learning resources in the “Data Science learning resources” folder within the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nIntroduce yourself to Ronnie, Siri & Petra from the Audit/QI and Methodology teams\n\nYou will work closely with them throughout the year. It is good to meet up with them so they can show you what they do in the Audit/QI & Methodology clinics and how this relates to the Data Clinic\n\nGet access to the Data Clinic email inbox\n\nEmail Tim Bonnici to obtain\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Progress of Project\n2021/22\n\n\nStart of project\n\nBackground to project including issues we hoped to address laid out in project overview document (see Notion document on Teams channel)\n\nSurvey done on 33 staff members in Critical Care that identified barriers to using data to complete audit/QI projects\n\n7/8 projects served through Data Clinic, including audit/QI/project feasibility projects.\n\nDraft project tracker set up to record length of time taken to serve data for data requests\n\nInformal qualitative feedback on the Data Clinic process gathered from joint meetings between Data lead/Data Fellows/BI team\n\nAdjustments made to running of the Data Clinic from this feedback including identifying the need for Audit/Methodology support for some projects before they attend Data Clinic, to clarify the aims and scope of projects.\n\nOverall, provided qualitative evidence that the Data Clinic initiative was feasible, beneficial to BI team and could help clinical staff.\n\n\n2022/23\n\n\nPlan for the year was to formalise outcome/process/balancing measurements for the Data Clinic & establish a reliable service.\n\nData Clinic email address and Teams channel set up, to create central repositiory for Data Clinic items. Github set up for code repository.\n\nAudit/QI clinic & Methodology clinic set up. Process of referring projects from these clinics to Data Clinic set up."

    "title": "Data Clinic: A ‘How to’ Template",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis document aims to provide an overview of the Data Clinic methodology, to provide interested parties with a template for setting up their own Data Clinic.\nThe information contained here is purposefully brief, as the methodology will need to be adapted to your local environment. However, the general structure aims to be flexible and thus transferable between different environments.\n\n\nWhat is the ‘Data Clinic’?\nThe Data Clinic is a Quality Improvement initiative to help frontline healthcare workers in Critical Care get useful, relevant data from Electronic Health Record Systems.\nThis is to improve the ease and speed of audits, QIPs, service evaluations and other projects performed in Critical Care.\nPlease note: although we serve limited data for research feasibility projects, we do not serve data for full research projects. This is because this requires further information governance and ethical approvals. We only serve projects that fall under the information governance approvals for use of data for departmental audit and governance.\n\n\nWhat are the issues that the Data Clinic is trying to solve?\nWe know that data-driven organisation are more effective, whether in business or healthcare.\nTo this end, in 2019 UCLH invested millions of pounds to obtain an fully electronic health record system (EHRS) in the form of EPIC with the aim of becoming a leader in the field of technologically-enabled healthcare. Other trusts around the UK are following suit, with increasing adoption of EHRS.\nPrior to the Data Clinic, the method for obtaining data from EPIC was through contacting the Business Intelligence (BI) team. This is a team of Data analysts employed by the Trust whose role it is to monitor performance data in their department and service data requests. It is likely that trusts who use EHRS will have similar teams.\nThis process had a number of issues:\n\nThere was little day-to-day contact between clinical staff and the BI team. As a result, many clinical staff are unaware of who the BI team are, what they do & how to contact them.\n\nWhen clinical staff did manage to get in contact with the BI team, the process of requesting data usually took the form of numerous back-and-forth emails between clinical staff and the BI team: clarifying what data was required vs what is possible to extract from the EHRS. This process was often time-consuming and frustrating for both the clinical staff and BI team for the following reasons:\n&gt; - Clinical staff often have a poor understanding of the nuances of data from EHRS including what data is available and how it will actually be useful for the project’s aims. They often had unrealistic expectations of what data could be provided and in what time frame.\n&gt; - Although the BI team have a good understanding of how to find data in EPIC and manage it, they may lack the clinical understanding and direction to extract the correct data and to provide learning from it.\n\n\n\nHow does the Data Clinic address these issues?\nThe Data Clinic aims to improve the process of providing data to clinical staff by combining the knowledge of EHRS data and data analytic skills of the BI team with the clinical knowledge and acumen of a “Data Fellow”. This “Data Fellow” is a critical care practitioner (e.g. Doctor, nurse) who has knowledge of the day-to-day working of the Critical Care unit (and usually has an interest in data science/Audit/QI) and can act as a “translator” between the clinical staff and BI team. This core Data Clinic team is supervised by a senior figure in the department - usually a consultant with an interest if data/Audit/QI - who is able to provide direction for the service and help manage contentious issues.\nWe make the process of contacting this team apparent. Once contacted, the clinical staff requiring data for a project have the opportunity to meet with the team face-to-face to discuss their project and its data requirements.\nThrough this combination, the Data Clinic aims:\n\nTo better understand the clinical question the Requestor is trying to answer.\n\nUsing our knowledge of the data that is available, clarify exactly what data is required to achieve the project’s aims.\n\nProvide that data for the Requestor as quickly as possible, in the form that the Requestor can use.\n\nWe hypothesise that this benefits both clinical staff requesting the data and the BI team.\nClinical staff:\n\nMakes the process of getting data from EHRS clearer\n\nEnhances understanding of the data that is available from EHRS & how it will be useful for their project aims\n\nEnsures the data provided is in a format that is useful to the Requestor and sensitive to their data analytic skills (e.g. there is no point providing a 10,000 row spreadsheet to someone who struggles to use Excel)\n\nOverall makes it easier to get the data needed to complete audit/QIP/service evaluations (thereby increasing the number of projects completed, departmental performance and eventually improving patient care)\n\nBI team:\n\nEnsures the data requests being recieved are realistic and relevant to achieving the aims of projects\n\nThrough the Data Fellow, provides a “go-to” individual for questions about clinical queries\n\nBetter understanding of clinical relevance of their work\n\nSaves time/frustration emailing back-and-forth with clinical staff\n\n\n\nHow do you measure the success of the Data Clinic?\nThere are multiple metrics that can be used to define “success”. What you choose may reflect your department’s goals. Examples include: speed of delivery of data, number of projects completed, complexity or projects completed, etc.\nOur two main recommendations from our experience are:\n\nUse a mixed methods approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data.\n\nThe full impact of the service is unlikely to be captured by a single metric - or by just qualitative vs quantitative feedback. Using a mixed methods approach has allowed us to capture a more complete picture of the Data Clinic’s impact.\n\n\nCollect Outcome, Process and Balancing measures. Similarly to the above, it shall allow you gather a more complete picture of the Data Clinic’s impact.\n\nOutcome measures capture the Data Clinic’s impact on your main aims of the project (i.e. How do you define success?)\n\nProcess measures capture the impact of the processes that you are using to try to achieve your goals (i.e. How are you achieving our success?)\n\nBalancing measures capture any unintended consequences of your project, which may offset the benefits it is bringing (e.g. You may be delivering data quickly, but is it of sufficient quality? Are the BI team overworked?)\n\n\nListed below is our strategy for measuring the impact of the Data Clinic & the reasons behind this approach. This can be copied directly, or adapted to your local environment. We chose 6 key measurements to focus on collecting to avoid overburdening the team. In reality, it may be possible to collect more than this.\nOutcome measures:\n\nRequestor satisfaction with the data delivered\n\nRequestor satisfaction with the Data Clinic process\n\nProcess measures:\n\nTime taken to deliver the data\n\nComplexity of the data delivered (e.g. in terms of size of data provided, variety of data, detail of data)\n\nQualitative feedback on the Data Clinic experience\n\nBalancing measures:\n\nFeedback from the Data Clinic team on their experience\n\nWe chose Requestor satisfaction with the data delivered and the Data Clinic process as our main outcome metrics. We chose this as we felt that this captured the benefit of the data requesting process more holistically and was adaptable to the different types of projects served.\nWe reasoned that measures such as “Time taken to deliver data” or “Complexity of data delivered” were better suited as Process measures as they are mediators - but not guarantees - of overall satisfaction. In general, one would expect satisfaction to go up as data is delivered faster and with more detail. However, if data is delivered fast at the expense of quality or is not sensitive to the Requestors needs, then satisfaction may not high.\nWe also collected qualitative feedback from the Requestors and the Data Clinic team on the Data Clinic experience. This allowed us to identify particular areas of success/areas to be improved from both the Requestor and Data Clinic team viewpoints.\n\n\n(Current) Structure of the Data Clinic\nBelow is a brief, introductory overview of the current structure of the Data Clinic. As we run this as a Quality Improvement initiative, we are continually updating our structure/processes in response to feedback.\n\nData Clinic core team\nData Fellow: critical care practitioner (e.g. Doctor, nurse) who has knowledge of the day-to-day working of the Critical Care unit.\n- So far this has been an SHO-level doctor with some data science acumen who has a 1/3rd to 2/3rd split job role between Data Clinic and clinical work in ICU. However this could reasonably done by any medical professional with time/interest.\nData Analyst: a data scientist (or similar) who has experince and knowledge of the EHRS system and how to extract data from it. Clinical knowledge is not necessary as that should be provided by the Data Fellow.\nProject supervisor: a senior departmental figure (e.g. consultant) who is able to provide guidance/direction to the project, but is perhaps not involved in the day t day running. Benefits from some knowledge of data/Audit/QI.\n\n\nHow are requests for data recieved?\nHow requests for data are received will depend what works best for your local situation.\nWe currently accept requests using a dedicated Data Clinic email address which Requestors can send requests to. This email address is also used to communicate with Requestors throughout the project. We have found this to be a useful single point of contact for Requestors.\n\n\nProcess once a request is recieved\nOnce a request has been received, it shall be screened by a member of the Data Clinic team. It will then be allocated to follow one of two pathways:\n\nThe request can be served by an existing report or we have a data extraction script already prepared that serves the purpose\n\nExample 1: A Requestor wants a list of all patients discharged from ICU in last month. This can be be served by an existing discharge from ICU report on EPIC.\n\nExample 2: A Requestor is performing the second cycle of a QIP and would like to re-collect data to assess the impact of their change. If the Data Clinic performed the 1st cycle data extraction, we may be able to reuse the existing data extraction script (with updated dates) to re-collect the data they need post-intervention.\n\n\nIn this case, the data request can often be quickly and easily served by the Data analyst without the need for a meeting.\n\nThe request cannot be served by an existing report/data extraction script\n\nExample 1: A Requestor is conducting a new QIP and would like data on blood gas results performed throughout a patient’s ICU stay. This is not covered by existing reports (e.g. ICNARC report) and as it is a new project, we do not have an existing script to perform the data extraction.\n\n\nIn this case, it will be necessary for the Requestor to meet with the Data Clinic team to discuss their project and its data requirements.\nIf a request is allocated to pathway “2”, then a meeting is arranged between the Requestor and the Data Clinic team.\nAt this meeting, we discuss:\n- The project aims\n- The data requirements including inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients\n- How the data will help answer the project aims\n- What data is actually available on EHRS and how this may affect the project aims/scope\n- What format the Requestor requires the data to be in (e.g. do they need an excel spreadsheet with raw data, or do they need the data processed into summary tables/graphs/etc)\nFollowing this meeting, the Data Clinic team will prepare the data extraction (or a limited subset of the full extraction).\nOnce this is done, the Data Clinic team meet again with the Requestor to show them the data extraction.\n- If the Requestor is happy with this data, the Data Clinic team then proceed to a full data extraction and deliver it to the Requestor.\n- If the Requestor are not satisfied, the extraction is revised according to the feedback received. Further meetings are then arranged with the Requestor after each round of extraction, until the data provided is adequate.\n(see the below flowchart for a graphical representation of this process)\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nA(Data request received) --&gt; B(Screened by Data Clinic team)\nB --&gt; C(Meeting with Data Clinic team)\nB --&gt; K(Can be served by existing report)\nC --&gt; D[1st extraction of data]\nD --&gt; F{2nd meeting between requestor & Data Clinic team}\nF --&gt; G[Happy with data]\nF --&gt; H[Revisions needed]\nG --&gt; I(Full extraction & data delivered)\nH --&gt; J(Further revision to extraction)\nJ --&gt; F\nK --&gt; L(Data delivered)\n\nlinkStyle default stroke: black;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement techniques\nTo collect the data on the Outcome/Process/Balancing measures above, we used the following techniques:\n1) Feedback surveys sent to Requestors\n\n2 surveys were used:\n1. “Immediate” feedback survey. This was sent to Requestors immediately after the request had been served. This focused on their experience of coming through the Data Clinic - and if they were satisfied with the process.\n2. “Delayed” feedback survey. This was sent to Requestors weeks-to-months later, after the Requestors have had time to use the data for their project. This focused on their satisfaction with the data delivered. By this point they will have had the opportunity to use the data for the purposes of their project, so can make a judgement on its true usefulness.\nThese feedback surveys also contain questions on other metrics our team are interested in (e.g. what barriers to using data did the Data Clinic help overcome)\n\n2) After-Action Review meetings between Data Clinic team members\n\nThese meetings are performed approximately every 3 months. We sit together and review the completed projects during that time.\nWe start by reviewing the quantitative metrics for the projects (e.g. how long did it take).\nWe then collect the thoughts of the Data Clinic team members on the project and how it went. We use an formal After-Action Review template to structure this discussion and identify areas for improvement.\nAs well as identifing areas that went well, these meetings provide a forum for Data Clinic team members to raise any issues they have identified (i.e. Balancing measures).\n\nTemplates for the feedback surveys and the After-Action Review meetings can be accessed by emailing one of the UCLH Data Clinic team members (see below).\n\n\nWords of wisdom & lessons learnt\nSince its inception, the Data Clinic has been a process of constant learning and development. We have shared below some of the lessons we have learnt, which may be relevant to your implementation.\n1. Help with project methodology\nThe process of coming through Data Clinic often reveals that projects are not are thoroughly considered as they first appear (and this applies for all grades/seniority of Requestors!) or that the realities of the data available leads to significant reformulation of the project aims/methodology.\nOne of the strengths of the Data Clinic has been the opportunity for the Requestor to meet face-to-face with the Data Clinic team to discuss their project before starting the data extraction. This meeting often reveals issues with the project’s inclusion criteria or methodology - something the Data Fellow is often able to spot using their clinical experience. Often these issues can be resolved in this first meeting which makes the subsequent data extraction more straightforward for the data analyst.\nHowever, there are occasions where it is obvious the project needs further consideration before progressing. It has therefore been enormous helpful for us to partner with Audit/QI/Methodology leads and experts within our department. We can now “refer” projects to these individuals if they need extra methodology support. Once they have been through this process, they come back to us with much clearer aims and considered data requests.\n2. Types of requests accepted\nWe initially limited the scope of the Data Clinic to just serving requests for Audit or QI projects.\nThis proved useful for limiting our workload while we developed our service. However, it quickly became apparent that many requests for projects that had clear potential benefits for the department did not fall into the category of Audit/QI.\nAs a result, we expended the scope of the projects we serve to:\n- Audits\n- QI\n- Service evaluations\n- Data for business cases\n- Research feasibility projects\n- Help with simple data analysis for existing datasets\n- Others (at the discretion of whether the Data Clinic team feels it is reasonable)\nThis has increased the numbers of projects we serve and has certainly increased the usefulness of the Data Clinic to the department.\nHowever, it does have the downside of increasing workload, so perhaps caution is warranted when first starting.\n3. Inbalances between the requested data and the data that is useful\nOne of the strengths of electronic health records is the ability to easily collect large volumes of data. However, we have found this can present unexpected challenges for clinical staff completing projects.\nRequestors can often ask for more data than they need or can handle. This can be requesting superfluous variables which are not relevant to the project’s aims or analyses. Alternatively, the volume of data produced can be overwhelming for Requestors who are used to smaller, manually collected datasets - especially for those with limited data science skills.\nIt is therefore important to establish early on what variables are truly important for the project and to try to limit the extraction to these. It is usually straightforward to add variables to existing requests if it later becomes apparent that extra data is needed. This ensures that the datasets produced are relevant to their purpose - limiting information overload for the Requestors and misuse of the valuable data analyst’s time in extracting unnecessary data.\n\n\nContact details for the UCLH Data Clinic\nIf you have questions on the above, or would like to discuss further, please email one of the individuals below (Dr Campbell will be the 1st point of call for most items).\nDr Ruaraidh Campbell: Lead Data Fellow for Data Clinic (ruaraidh.campbell@nhs.net)\nHumayra Chowdhury: BI analyst (humayra.chowdhury@nhs.net)\nDr Tim Bonnici: Data Lead for Critical Care (t.bonnici@nhs.net)\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe Data Clinic has only been possible due to the contribution of numerous indivduals in addition to those listed above.

A multidisciplinary team from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) spent two years developing the Experimental Medicine Application Platform (EMAP) platform to make fuller, faster, more effective use of data in electronic health records (EHRs).\nThe COVID pandemic saw them demonstrate the quality of the platform and the team. Using the EMAP infrastructure they rapidly created a bed management tool that helped take pressure off north London intensive care units (ICUs). Now the team has facilitated a series of grants to take their work into new areas including better antibiotic stewardship."

This allowed staff to be allocated where they were most needed and kept transfer beds available at all times. The tool supported the treatment of 434 critically ill patients (including retrieving 162 patients to the UCHL surge centre) from overstretched units across north London."
